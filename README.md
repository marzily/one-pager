# One-Pager

To Use App:
Clone repo and `$npm start`

### Spec
Create a simple form with First Name, Last Name and Email (and a Submit button).
1. You must use React.js.  (I’ve preselected that Javascript Framework for you in this template)
2. This will be a SINGLE PAGE APP.  The page should not refresh or redirect to another page.
3. Define the following fields as “Required”:
  1. First Name
  2. Email
4. When the Submit Button is clicked, execute a validation routine.  
  1. all required fields are populated
  2. Email must properly follow traditional email address format. (name@fully-qualified-domain-name)
    1. For simplicity, you will only allow .com, .net, and .org Top Level Domains
5. Populate the results of the validation within an HTML element on the page.
